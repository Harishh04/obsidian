## Operators :
#### AND : 

| a   | b   | a & b |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0     |
| 0   | 1   | 0     |
| 1   | 0   | 0     |
| 1   | 1   | 1     |
> OBSERVATION : 
> ==when you & 1 with any number  digits remain the same : ==

| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   |

---

### OR :
**If any one is true , everything is true**
 
| a   | b   | a or b |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| 0   | 0   | 0      |
| 0   | 1   | 0      |
| 1   | 0   | 0      |
| 1   | 1   | 1      |
- - -
### XOR  (^):
**only one should be true , if two are true , then false**

| a   | b   | a ^ b |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0     |
| 0   | 1   | 1     |
| 1   | 0   | 1     |
| 1   | 1   | 0     |
> ==OBSERVATION==
> ==If you XOR a number with i you get the compliment of the number== 
> ==`a ^ 1 = -a`==
 
### COMPLIMENT (~):
~1 = 0

## NUMBER SYSTEMS :

### Decimal :
normal numbers from 0 to 9 
base 10 
### Binary :
uses numbers 0 and 1 
base 2
10<sub>10</sub> = 1010<sub>2</sub>
### Octal :
uses numbers from 0 to 7 
base 8 

| Decimal | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 16  | 17  | 18  | 19  | 20  |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Octal   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 16  | 17  | 20  | 21  | 22  | 23  | 24  |
so basically , after 8 in decimal , octal uses its available numbers and moves from 10
### Hexadecimal :
uses numbers from 0 to 9 and "A" till "F"
base 16 
10<sub>10</sub> = A<sub>16</sub>

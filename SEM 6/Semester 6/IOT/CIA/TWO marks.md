### **6. Show the difference between sourcing and sinking currents.**

- **Sourcing Current:** Device supplies current to the load.
    
- **Sinking Current:** Device receives current from the load.

### **8. Tell the difference between priority scheduling and Rate Monotonic scheduling.**

- **Priority Scheduling:** Tasks are executed based on priority, can be pre-emptive or non-pre-emptive.
    
- **Rate Monotonic Scheduling:** A fixed-priority algorithm where shorter period tasks get higher priority.

### **8. What do you mean by Earliest Deadline First scheduling?**

- **EDF Scheduling:** A dynamic scheduling algorithm where the task with the nearest deadline gets the highest priority.
    

---

### **10. How will you define sketches in Arduino?**

- **Sketch:** A program written in the Arduino IDE, usually in C/C++, that controls the microcontrollerâ€™s behavior.

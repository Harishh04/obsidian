## TWO MARKS
### **1. List the main features of the 8051 microcontroller.**

ðŸ“Œ **(Set 1 - Q1, Set 2 - Q3)**

- 8-bit microcontroller with Harvard architecture
    
- 4KB ROM, 128 bytes RAM
    
- 32 I/O pins (4 ports)
    
- Two 16-bit timers/counters
    
- Full-duplex UART for serial communication
    
- Supports interrupt handling
    

---

### **2. Difference between pre-emptive and non-pre-emptive scheduling.**

ðŸ“Œ **(Set 1 - Q8, Set 2 - Q6)**

- **Pre-emptive Scheduling:** Allows tasks to be interrupted and resumed later (higher priority task can take over).
    
- **Non-Pre-emptive Scheduling:** Once a task starts, it runs until completion (no task switching until it finishes).

### **3. What is a sensor?**

ðŸ“Œ **(Set 1 - Q9)**  
A **sensor** detects physical changes (temperature, pressure, motion, etc.) and converts them into electrical signals.

---

### **4. Difference between a sensor and a transducer.**

ðŸ“Œ **(Set 2 - Q9)**

- **Sensor:** Detects physical changes and provides raw signals.
    
- **Transducer:** Converts energy from one form to another (e.g., electrical to mechanical).

### **5. Define RTOS.**

ðŸ“Œ **(Set 1 - Q7)**  
A **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)** is an OS designed for real-time applications, ensuring predictable task execution with strict timing constraints.

---

### **6. Define context switching in RTOS.**

ðŸ“Œ **(Set 2 - Q5)**  
**Context switching** is the process where the CPU saves the current task's state and switches to another task, allowing multitasking in RTOS.

---

### **7. Characteristics and qualities of a Good RTOS.**

ðŸ“Œ **(Set 2 - Q7)**

- Fast task switching
    
- Minimal interrupt latency
    
- Efficient memory management
    
- Priority-based scheduling
    
- Predictable behavior (deterministic)
